'''
BUI provides an abstract backend to help in building user interfaces. The
backend provides parsing and unserializing of the user interface structure,
events and constraints.

Currently a frontend is available for Blender. A frontend for Pyglet is being
planned.

Note that the library is still very much work in progress. The implementation
of frontend for Blender is already in testable state however.
